    <h1>Stories of Staying Alive</h1>
    <p id="about-me">
      I study depression and write about why we break and how we mend.
      I talk to therapists, scholars, sufferers, survivors who lean into
      despair with candour, curiosity and courage, who challenge the
      stigma and illuminate the truth behind mental illness. Who show the
      rest of us how to adore and endure life.

      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
      Hi, I am Elitsa. <br>
      I was a stock market analyst in Washington DC, then flew over to
      Bali to join a startup incubator, then co-founded a software
      business in London, and as the company grew and I got too
      comfortable, I knew it was time to leave.
      Now I spend my days prying into mental health. My quest is to
      break through the stigma and the lazy cheerleading, and sit down
      to talk about depression with candour, curiosity and courage.
